OCaml client for Docker Remote API
==================================

This library provides an OCaml client for
[Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/),
version 1.29.
This library is tested with the
[community edition](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
of Docker.

Note that the OPAM and ocamlfind packages are called `docker-api` (to
distinguish them from other packages related to Docker) but the OCaml
module is named `Docker` (because the code reads better with that name
IMHO).


Compilation & installation
--------------------------

The easier way to install this library is to use
[OPAM](http://opam.ocaml.org/).  Just type:

    opam install docker-api

This library depends on [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) (to
compile) and [Yojson](https://github.com/ocaml-community/yojson).

To compile as a developer, just type `make` and then `make install` to
install it.

Documentation
-------------

Please read the [interface](src/docker.mli) or the
[HTML version](http://chris00.github.io/ocaml-docker/doc/docker-api/Docker/).


Testing
-------

If you compile using `make`, the tests will be built.  In order to run
them, make sure that the latest Debian image is installed — if not,
simply issue `docker pull debian:latest` in a shell — and issue `make
test`.
